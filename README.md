## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I make a living writing OCaml at [Tarides](https://tarides.com/), where my primary interest is debugging support, Garbage Collection, and general systems hacking.

Previously, I have worked with other functional languages like Haskell, Lisp and Erlang. 

I am active in the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) community as a contributor to the OCaml compiler, and an author and contributor to various OCaml libraries. I occasionally contribute in the [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) community to various project around [icicle](https://github.com/icicle-lang/) and [cloud-haskell](https://github.com/haskell-distributed/).

I'm currently work on debugging support in OCaml and building libraries to support that ([mach](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/mach), [object](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/object) and [durin](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/durin)).
